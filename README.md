A set of small perl packages that allows finding and parsing js files given a root folder and 1 or more paths relative to the root where javascript will be searched for. Parsing looks for Ext.define("myClass",{...}) calls and parses "extend", "mixins", and "requires" properties from the {...} block.

For parsing ext3 syntax an older version of this project has been tagged as ext3. The ext3 version looks for jsDoc comments "@class" and "@extends" and also looks for the 2 & 3 arg version of Ext.extend() to determine dependencies ...

Dependencies are resolved and the testRun.pl script generates a jsb3 file listing js files in the order they need to be loaded to ensure proper code completion from within the spket js editor (the .jsb3 can also be used with the sencha SDK if desired to package all your js for deployment)

The source was written with the intention of it being run from within the eclipse environment using the e.p.i.c eclipse perl plugin. The spket plugin should have an extjs lib setup and the sdk.jsb3 included before the jsb3 generated by this project for correct load order of dependencies.
